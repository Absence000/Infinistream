WALTER WHITE: Alright, we need to come up with a plan to deal with Gus.

SKYLER WHITE: Maybe we should hire a magician to distract him.

JESSE PINKMAN: A magician? Really?

WALTER WHITE: Actually, that might just be crazy enough to work.

(They start researching magicians in the area and find an eccentric one named Magic Mike who claims he can make anyone disappear.)

WALTER WHITE: Magic Mike, we need your help with a very important task.

MAGIC MIKE: Abracadabra! What seems to be the problem, my fine friends?

JESSE PINKMAN: We need you to make Gus Fring disappear.

MAGIC MIKE: (excitedly) Ooh, a disappearing act! I love a challenge. Just leave it to Magic Mike!

SKYLER WHITE: Are we really doing this?

WALTER WHITE: Desperate times call for desperate measures, Skyler.

(The group watches as Magic Mike pulls out a fake wand, waves it around, and mumbles some incomprehensible magic words.)

MAGIC MIKE: And now, ladies and gentlemen, behold the great disappearing act!

(Nothing happens. Gus Fring walks into the room, looking bemused.)

GUS FRING: What is this, a children's birthday party?

(The room falls silent as Magic Mike awkwardly puts away his wand.)

MAGIC MIKE: Uh... ta-da?

WALTER WHITE: This may have been a mistake.
